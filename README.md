# PyCorrupter

PyCorrupter lets you corrupt files in a directory (like Minecraft server files or game directories) with just a few clicks. Whether you’re curious about game corruption or just want to have some fun, this little tool can turn your files into beautiful messes.

## What It Does
- **Corrupt Files**: Pick any folder, and PyCorrupter will start corrupting the files inside.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python, so you’re probably good to go!)

You’ve got two options:

## Use Case: Minecraft Server Chaos

Let’s say you’ve got a Minecraft server with a bunch of world files. What happens if they get corrupted? Who knows! PyCorrupter lets you corrupt those files and test how the game handles it. It’s like playing Russian roulette with your game files — fun, unpredictable, and maybe a little dangerous!

## A Few Warnings
- **Don't Corrupt Important Files**: This is all about having fun and experimenting, but be careful — corrupted files may be unrecoverable. Don’t use it on stuff you care about *unless you have backups*.
- **It’s Meant to Be Fun**: This tool is here to add some randomness and surprise, so use it for entertainment, testing, or just because you’re curious!
